# expense-tracker

This is a RESTful Web Service in Java using Spring. I created this project while refreshing my knowledge of Sping, Web Services, JPA, etc. 

This project is designed to support simple tracking of everyday expenses. I needed a demo project to practice with and, as it turns out, all the expense tracking tools I've used never quite gave me what I wanted. They were always too simple or too complex. 

The front end for this service will be built using React, which I am currently learning. I have plenty of experience with server-side component-oriented frameworks, but I haven't had the opportunity to learn any of the client-side frameworks until recently. 

# todo

1) At present this service uses an H2 in-memory database. I need to prepare sql inserts in data.sql to preload it for further testing and experimenation.
2) Migrate to Postgres or some other db. 
3) Implement security and authentication. 
4) Implement testing.
5) I'm not quite satisfied with all the path definitions. They're still under review.
6) Implement methods and queries to support various visualizations.
